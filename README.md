# Sans Comic Sans
Have you ever used Comic Sans font in a poster or a presentation in a non-sarcastic way? Is there photographic proof of this regretful moment (giving the benefit of the doubt here and not using plural)? Well, have no fear, here is an app to hide any instance of that shameful deed - an app for obfuscating parts of an image using a PRNG! 

P.S. App can be used to erase any part of image regardless of content. It's not like I trained a neural network to detect Comic Sans only (though that might be a good idea for the future).

## Installation
- install [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) for Chrome/Firefox in 'development' mode
